Rock-Paper-Scissors in Python
Game may be simple to code but have you thought of many ways it can be written?
Here are different ways to code Rock-Paper-Scissors in Python:

1. Solving error caused from my coding through ChatGPT
      (1.1) Error Code
      NameError: name 'play_again' is not defined. Did you mean: 'player_again'?.
      changed 'play_again' to 'player_again' and woorks

      (1.2) Fixed Error Code Through ChatGPT
      Removed redundant print statement
      Concise and organized


2. Create Rock-Paper-Scissors though ChatGPT
      (2.1) ChatGPT Solution
      input: Create me a Python code for Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
      script result is the same as other Rock-Paper-Scissors scripts
      this script has multiple functions for specific task
      Verbose for having functions for a simple game

      (2.2)
      input: Have the code to input yes/no again for wrong input
      modified to have the play again to input either yes or no through while loop
      works as intended.


3. Coding from Brocode 
      (3.1) Brocode Solution

      minimized lines of code through specified win and tie condition
            with everything "else" lose condition
      deep understanding of the rock-paper-scissors conditions
      used "running= False" to end while loop


4. Coding from Brocode
      (4.1) Brocode Solution
      Part 38
      Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKHEtdqhLK8&t=141s
      Verbose but easy to understand with every win, tie, and lose conditions written
      used "break" to terminate while loop
